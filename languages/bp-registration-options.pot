"This BuddyPress extension allows you to enable user moderation for new "
"members, as well as help create a private network for your users. If "
"moderation is enabled, any new members will be denied access to your "
"BuddyPress and bbPress areas on your site, with the exception of their own "
"user profile. They will be allowed to edit and configure that much. They "
"will also not be listed in the members lists on the frontend until approved. "
"Custom messages are available so you can tailor them to the tone of your "
"website and community. When an admin approves or denies a user, email "
"notifications will be sent to let them know of the decision."
